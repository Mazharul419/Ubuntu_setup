# Ubuntu_setup
This is a repo that guides you through the set up of Ubuntu via Windows Subsytem for Linux.

Intro
The Windows Subsystem for Linux, or WSL, is a program designed for developers to access the power of both Windows and Linux OS without the need of a virtual machine or dual-boot setup. This repo acts as a guide for installing Linux on my Windows machine so others as well as myself can benefit.

1. Running wsl -- install
   To install wsl we must first run the command in Powershell.
   To do this I will run Powershell from my desktop as an administrator:

We can then run the wsl --install command and hit ENTER which will begin the installation - once done it should look like the below:

Upon restart WSL will display a start screen that can be exited and the WSL program itself:

I open the Ubuntu app instead as a preference - I am unsure what the differences are between this and WSL.
